For this weeks exercise you need to analyse a dataset and prepare a machine learning model 
to predict a property of that dataset. The dataset is the data on Titanic passengers and can be found in the data folder.

There are two parts to todays exercise:
- Analyse and visualize the data. Look for missing values and for correlations between features, as well as between feature and target. Prepare a brief report with some visualisations of the data, and with a summary of what you observed. This can be a jupyter notebok, some other document, or just part of the PR description with images pasted into it.
- Train an ML model that will predict for any passenger whether they will survive. Determine whether this is a classification or regression task, and use an appropriate model. Spend some time on optimizing the algorithm and hyperparameters. Report the matthews correlation coefficient calculated on a test set as part of your submission.
